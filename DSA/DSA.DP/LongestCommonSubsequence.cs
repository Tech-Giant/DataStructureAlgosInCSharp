     *   Leetcode : 1143
         Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

        A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string
        with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of 
        the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). 
        A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

        Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
        Output: 3  
        Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
